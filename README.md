- Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
There is nothing special about this game only beautiful CSS and good layout


- What features did you include?
I included tow option that you can play with friend or play against the computer

- Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
Most of my function based on IF condition also used for loop with breaks


- What was the most difficult part of the project?
The most difficult part in this project is attempting to creating AI and  know what I did for now just computer play in order from 0 to 9

- What was your favourite part to work on?
I enjoyed working on CSS

- What would you like to add next?
in Future I'm planning to do landing page and fixing that I maybe I will do minimax algorithm  and create score table and also button to run AI

- Unsolved problems
I have  problems with the AI and my code not sorted very well I mean you can see function inside function and hard to read
